# VoltEdge-Electronics-Data-Driven-Business-Decisions

## 1. Project Overview
VoltEdge Electronics is a fast-growing, U.S.-based retail chain that specializes in consumer electronics. The company operates with a dual strategy: retailing products from global brands (e.g., Apple, Sony) and manufacturing its own VoltEdge-branded products. The objective of this project was to analyze two years of company data to help VoltEdge make better business decisions and address key challenges.

## 2. Data Sources

The analysis was based on the following four datasets, provided in a single Excel file:

Product Sales Data: Contains sales data for each product and store for 2023 and 2024.

Stores Details: Includes store-level information such as location and quarterly operating costs.

Products Details: Contains information at the product code level.

Customer Level Data: Includes customer data on store visits, average order value, and brands purchased.

## 3. Business Questions
The analysis focused on addressing the following three key business questions:

1. How should VoltEdge manage their inventory and logistics to prevent out-of-stock situations in certain stores while optimizing costs? 

2. What strategies can VoltEdge implement to increase the sales of their own-branded products? 

3. How can VoltEdge use customer segmentation to create a more personalized shopping experience and improve customer loyalty?

## 4. Key Findings and Recommendations 
Based on the analysis, the following findings and recommendations were developed for each business question:

### 4.1. Inventory and Logistics Management
Finding: Stores 12 and 19 face a higher out-of-stock rate compared to other stores. This is attributed to a higher number of orders, a larger average number of products per order, and a higher number of returned orders

Recommendation: Implement a dynamic inventory system that adjusts stock levels based on real-time sales data and demand forecasts.

Recommendation: Improve logistics for these specific stores by collaborating with local suppliers or establishing small warehouses nearby.

### 4.2. Increasing VoltEdge-Branded Product Sales
Finding: VoltEdge-branded products have a lower average rating (3.84) compared to global brands (4.25), which suggests potential quality or user experience issues.

Finding: The price-to-rating ratio for VoltEdge products (1.7) is lower than for global brands (1.9), indicating that customers may not perceive the brand's value proposition as strong

Recommendation: Enhance product quality and design by investing in R&D and gathering customer feedback.

Recommendation: Refine pricing strategies for VoltEdge-branded products to better reflect their value and customer willingness to pay

### 4.3. Customer Segmentation and Loyalty
Finding: The customer base can be segmented into four distinct clusters: "Occasional Shoppers," "Tech Enthusiasts," "Budget Buyers," and "High-Value Spenders"

Finding: "Occasional Shoppers" are price-sensitive, have a low average order value ($50-100), and mainly purchase VoltEdge products. "Tech Enthusiasts" purchase both global and VoltEdge brands, have a medium average order value ($150-250), and are rating-conscious. "High-Value Spenders" have a high average order value ($400+), purchase global brands, and are responsive to promotions.

Recommendation: Target "Occasional Shoppers" and "Tech Enthusiasts" with personalized promotions and bundled offers

Recommendation: Improve customer loyalty among "High-Value Spenders" by offering exclusive early access to new products or special events.
